# Kickpact — bet on football with a wallet that's yours

> A self‑custodial, mobile‑first **World Cup prediction app**. Your wallet holds **USD₮** and never leaves your phone — then you bet three ways: trustless **Pacts** with a friend, a Tinder‑style on‑chain **Duel**, or real‑money **Polymarket** markets. Fans of the same match meet in a **peer‑to‑peer watch party** over Hyperswarm — no server, messages signed by your wallet.

## Why Kickpact

Football is the world's biggest social ritual — and the way people already "bet" on it (group chats, side‑bets with friends, the office pool) is trustless in spirit but custodial and messy in practice: someone holds the money, someone has to be trusted to pay out.

Kickpact keeps the ritual and removes the trust problem. Every stake sits in **on‑chain escrow that only the outcome can release**, the money lives in a **wallet you alone control**, and the whole thing feels like a pixel‑art mobile game rather than a DeFi terminal.

> **Your keys. Your USD₮. Your call on the match.**

---

## Three ways to bet — one wallet, one USD₮ balance

| | Tier | What it is | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🤝 | **Pacts** | Escrow a bet with a friend (or an open room anyone can join). Both sides stake equal USD₮; the winner claims the pot, the loser's escrow auto‑releases. Resolve by mutual agreement or a neutral arbiter. | `KickpactPacts` on **Sepolia** |
| ⚔️ | **Duels** | A Tinder‑style 1v1: both players swipe UP/DOWN through a commit‑revealed deck of "will this asset beat its strike?" cards. The contract escrows both stakes and pays the better reader — a correct contrarian call scores more than following the crowd. Free practice‑vs‑bot mode too. | `KickpactDuel` on **Sepolia** |
| 📈 | **Polymarket** | Trade **real‑money** World Cup markets **in‑app**: the WDK wallet EIP‑712‑signs Fill‑or‑Kill orders and posts them straight to Polymarket's CLOB (live order‑book prices, USDC.e allowance flow — byte‑identical to the official SDK, proven by test). | Polymarket CLOB on **Polygon** |

The in‑app **Swap** and **Bridge** screens exist to move USD₮ onto Polygon and fund that third tier; the testnet Pacts and Duels stay on Sepolia.

---

## WDK track — a wallet that never leaves the phone

Kickpact is built around the **Wallet Development Kit**: the wallet *is* the identity, and the same key that holds your USD₮ also signs your bets and your chat.

- **Secure storage (real WDK).** The seed is sealed with [`@tetherto/wdk-react-native-secure-storage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tetherto/wdk-react-native-secure-storage) into the device keychain (Secure Enclave / StrongBox) behind biometrics — `apps/mobile/src/storage.native.ts`.
- **Self‑custodial wallet.** On‑device BIP‑39 seed, 12‑word backup / import, an explicit `INITIALIZING → NO_WALLET → BACKUP_PENDING → READY` state machine that mirrors WDK RN core — `apps/mobile/src/wallet.tsx`.
- **Swap** — real swaps via the Velora/ParaSwap aggregator (`src/swap.ts`), shaped to drop in `@tetherto/wdk-protocol-swap-velora-evm`.
- **Bridge** — cross‑chain USD₮ via the **USD₮0 / LayerZero OFT** (`src/bridge.ts`), mirroring `@tetherto/wdk-protocol-bridge-usdt0-evm` with the verified OFT addresses + LayerZero EIDs.
- **Fiat on/off‑ramp** — MoonPay buy/sell widget (`src/fiat.ts`), mirroring `@tetherto/wdk-protocol-fiat-moonpay`.

> **Honest scope:** secure‑storage is a live WDK integration. Swap / bridge / fiat / core are implemented in ethers against the exact WDK module surface so the real `@tetherto/wdk-protocol-*` packages drop straight in — and the bridge registry (OFT contracts + LayerZero EIDs) is **pinned by a CI parity test to the real `@tetherto/wdk-protocol-bridge-usdt0-evm` config**, so it can never drift from Tether's shipped values.

## Pears track — the peer‑to‑peer watch party

Open any match and you can **join the room**: a serverless watch party where fans of the same game find each other on the Hyperswarm DHT.

- **Real P2P.** A **Bare** worklet (`react-native-bare-kit`) runs **Hyperswarm** on the phone and joins a topic derived from the match id — `hash("kickpact/match/<gameId>")` — so everyone watching the same game lands in the same swarm. `apps/mobile/src/room.ts`.
- **Signed identity = wallet identity.** Every message is signed with your WDK key and verified with `ethers.verifyMessage`; verified peers render ✓, unsigned ones ⚠.
- **Bet from the room.** Propose a wager in‑chat and it opens an on‑chain `KickpactPacts` escrow (open room, keeper arbiter); other fans tap *join bet* to take the other side. QR "join‑escrow" flows through the same contract.
- **Desktop app (Mac / Windows / Linux).** [`apps/desktop`](apps/desktop) is the Watch Party as a real desktop app — the same pixel UI, built on the Pears stack: an Electron shell whose P2P layer runs in a **Bare worker** spawned by `pear-runtime` (the [hello-pear-electron](https://github.com/holepunchto/hello-pear-electron) architecture). `apps/pear/` additionally ships an **interactive terminal peer on Bare**: `bare cli.js <gameId> <nick>` — type to chat, same rooms.
- **Verified live, end‑to‑end.** The Android release build, the Electron desktop app, and Bare CLI peers all met in room `760510` over the **public DHT**: messages flowed every direction, and the phone's reply rendered everywhere as `0x287B…D4d9 ✓ signed` — wallet‑verified, no server anywhere. Screenshots above.

## What's on‑chain

Solidity 0.8.28, Foundry, deployed to **Ethereum Sepolia** (`chainId 11155111`). Source in [`apps/duel-evm/src`](apps/duel-evm/src), addresses in [`apps/duel-evm/deployed.json`](apps/duel-evm/deployed.json).

| Contract | Address (Sepolia) |
| --- | --- |
| **KickpactDuel** | [`0x045Ad96EB24CE29f02C4E41542507DE26FE13895`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x045Ad96EB24CE29f02C4E41542507DE26FE13895) |
| **KickpactPacts** (v2, open rooms) | [`0xc84a624109e6406d1a5Aa8413B19a1CFFCFe7f5A`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xc84a624109e6406d1a5Aa8413B19a1CFFCFe7f5A) |
| **MockUSDT** (USD₮, 6dp, open faucet) | [`0x4802B35fFE360CAcF7bc22702544DDA207b950A3`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4802B35fFE360CAcF7bc22702544DDA207b950A3) |
| **oracleKeeper** (settles duels + match results) | [`0x72AE77B55A9195526170bb4D8D2B6f20d37b8262`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x72AE77B55A9195526170bb4D8D2B6f20d37b8262) |

Stakes and payouts are in **USD₮** (6 decimals); gas is Sepolia ETH. On Polygon, the swap/bridge/Polymarket tier uses real Tether (`0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F`). Cross‑chain moves go over **USD₮0** (LayerZero OFT).

## Run it locally

```bash
bun install                       # install all workspaces (Bun ≥ 1.3)

# mobile app
bun --filter mobile start         # Expo dev server
#   → build a dev/release APK from apps/mobile/android, or run on a device

# desktop watch party (Mac/Win/Linux)
cd apps/desktop && bun install && bun run start

# contracts
cd apps/duel-evm && forge test    # Solidity test suite
```

The self‑custodial wallet generates a real seed on first launch. **First run:** grab a drop of free Sepolia ETH for gas ([Google faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)) — the app links you there if you forget — then mint USD₮ from the in‑app faucet and you're ready to bet.

## Tests

Three layers, all runnable offline:

| Suite | What it covers | Run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Contracts** | 27 Foundry tests — duel lifecycle, pact escrow, refunds, timeouts | `cd apps/duel-evm && forge test` |
| **Android app — unit** | Room wire protocol (framing, signed payloads, ethers verify), deterministic pact terms + keccak parity with the contract, ESPN fixture parser, CLOB client primitives (HMAC auth vectors, EIP‑712 order round‑trip, SDK rounding math) | `cd apps/mobile && bun test src` |
| **Android app — integration** | The app's exact P2P wire end‑to‑end over a **hermetic in‑process DHT**; **CLOB wire parity** — our hand‑rolled client produces byte‑identical signed orders to the official `@polymarket/clob-client` (signature included, both exchanges); live CLOB API (Gamma markets, order‑book price, L1 EIP‑712 auth deriving real API creds); WDK bridge‑registry parity | `cd apps/mobile && npm run test:integration` |
| **Desktop app — unit** | Room core: topic derivation (cross‑platform constant), chunk‑safe framing, message shapes, signed/unsigned badges | `cd apps/desktop && npm test` |
| **Desktop app — integration** | Real Hyperswarm rooms on the hermetic DHT: peers meet + chat, room isolation, wallet‑signature verification, pact passthrough | `cd apps/desktop && npm run test:integration` |

## Demo notes & status

**Shipped — live on Sepolia.** Self‑custodial WDK onboarding, the three bet tiers (Pacts / Duels / Polymarket), the Hyperswarm watch‑party rooms with wallet‑signed chat and in‑room escrow bets, and the swap/bridge rails all run end‑to‑end. The screenshots above are from the release build (`io.kickpact.app`) on a fresh, unfunded testnet wallet.
